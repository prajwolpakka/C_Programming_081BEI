Welcome to the C Programming Project Repository (081BEI). Each team is required to submit their project by following the instructions below.

📌 Submission Instructions
One team member forks this repository into their GitHub account (Team Lead):

Go to the instructor's repository: C_Programming_081BEI.
Click the Fork button at the top-right corner to create a copy under your GitHub account.
The entire team clones the forked repository:

git clone https://github.com/TEAM_LEAD_USERNAME/C_Programming_081BEI.git
Create a new branch for your team using your roll numbers in ascending order, formatted as two-digit numbers.

Example: If the team consists of roll numbers 1, 4, 5, 45, the branch name should be:
01040545
Create the branch using the following command:
git checkout -b 01040545
Make changes in your cloned repository by adding project files inside a folder named after your branch name:

01040545/proposal/ → Your project proposal document.
01040545/code/ → Your source code files.

Commit and push changes to the forked repository:

git add .
git commit -m "Added project submission for team 01040545"

The Team Lead opens a Pull Request (PR) from their forked repository to the main branch of this repository.

Submit the PR link to the instructor for review.
